      <p>
        I am a Junior web developer and currently taking a Coding Bootcamp at The Unviversity of Washington. This will be
        an intensive course and I am learning quickly on how to use HTML, Advanced CSS, and JavaScript. This will not be the
        end of my knowledge, as we are still in the early weeks of the course but I am confident that I will receive my
        certificate with a broad and detailed knowledge of many web developer's today. Currently, I am working at a 
        Pediatric Dental Office. Although, my current background does not have any web developer skills, I have developed good
        communication skills in a professional setting.

          Stargazer! is my first group Project that we had for our class. We were asked to start a project from scratch, so we decided to make a website that
          helps people know when it is the best day to look at the night sky.
